Quicksort is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of a random access file or an array in order. Implement the following variations of quicksort algorithm: 
  1- Basic quicksort where the chosen pivot is the first element of an array. 
  2- Quicksort where the pivot is the median of three elements of an array (first, last, and middle). 
  3- Quicksort where the pivot is the median of three randomly chosen elements of an array. 

Perform the following to test the implemented algorithms: 
  a. Generate large arrays (of size n=105) with different distributions reflecting the algorithmsâ€™ best, average, and worst cases.
  b. Compare the efficiencies theoretically and experimentally by reporting results in Tables or Charts.
  c. Analyze the results and state your implications.
