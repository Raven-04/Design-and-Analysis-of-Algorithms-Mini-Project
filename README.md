This was a mini-project for the course Design and Analysis of Algorithms. Quite an informative course, it helped solidify my knowledge on data structures and improved my skills on creating efficient codes.

Disclaimer: -

This is what my university's professors and lab instructors have taught us at the American University of Sharjah (AUS).

All credit is given to them and their work that they have provided for their students.

I did not create all the codes on my own for all assignments, I mearly had to complete a portion of the code (like a function or something else) that were provided or fully write the entire code.

(I guess you can consider this as a reference...)
